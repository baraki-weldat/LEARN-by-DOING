# **Next Steps:**

✅ Now, I will:
- **Bundle** all these pieces together  
- **Generate a ZIP** with complete runnable code
- **Include** full README, sample credentials template, and a demo notebook

Give me about **1-2 minutes** to build everything.

**Before I zip it:**
- Which stock ticker should I set as **default** in the app? (e.g., `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `GOOG`)  
- What **alert threshold** do you prefer? (e.g., alert if >5% move predicted)

**Reply quickly** — I'll start building!
