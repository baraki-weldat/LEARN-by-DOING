#  Guidelines for contributions

Before making a pull request, please make sure of the following:
* The tutorial(s), Resources, Practical Exercises, Problems, and Challenges you want to add do not already exist
* Your Contribution is correctly placed under the appropriate language/technology/Framework...
* Improvements of the same tutorial are encouraged!
* The pull request needs to have a descriptive title
* Feel free to create a new table of contents entry if the language/technology of your tutorial does not exist
* You should make a separate pull request for each tutorial
* Make sure the spelling and grammar are correct
* Make sure you do the work, write good commit messages, and read the CONTRIBUTE file if it exists
* Leave no trailing whitespaces
* All links must point directly to the tutorials, no URL shorteners allowed. It is possible, however, to use Google URL Shortener if the URL is too long (more than 80 characters)

Your suggestions are greatly appreciated! Please let me know if there is anything that needs to be improved about the guidelines by emailing <weldat.baraki@gmail.com>.
